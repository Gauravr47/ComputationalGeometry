# Computational Geometry Library (C++)

This project is a modern, header-driven C++ library for fundamental computational geometry operations. It includes efficient, reusable components for manipulating 2D/3D geometric primitives, spatial partitioning, and mesh construction — designed with clarity and extensibility in mind.

> 💡 Built from scratch during a deep-dive into geometry and algorithms.
